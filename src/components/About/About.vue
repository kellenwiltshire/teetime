				Do you have a large Golf group? Do you still try to randomize Foursome's
				with names out of a hat or tiles out of a bag? Do you have to keep track
				of who-carpools-with-who and who needs a later start time?
			</p>
			<p>
				This might be for you then! Just follow the simple steps on the How To
				page and generate a completely random and properly organized list of
				Foursome's in seconds that is ready to print and send to your Group or
				League!

				This project was created as a spin-off from my Golf League Tracker Web
				App(which can be viewed on my portfolio site below).

				This project was also used as a way to learn VueJS and expand my
